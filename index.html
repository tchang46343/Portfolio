        <h1 class="grabberIntro">
          Hello, I’m Terrance Chang.
        </h1>
        <p>
          I'm a Full Stack Web Developer, and I can bring value to your company
          by designing and implementing a custom website that your customers
          will enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a web developer, I embrace difficult coding problems, and whether
          working within a team or working individually the knowledge to gain by
          solving a difficult problem will further advance my software
          development career. In addition, web development presents the
          opportunity for me to express my design creativity. By utilizing
          methods such as selecting a color palette, experimenting with
          different fonts, and having a responsive design can alter the user
          experience. Finally, my meticulous coding approach to building a
          website is to always optimize my code functions, use different
          libraries when appropriate, and secure websites to prevent hacking
          vulnerability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Away from my computer, I enjoy an active lifestyle whether it be
          working out at the gym, walking my cat, or repairing cars. For me,
          it’s important to find a happy medium of detoxing from technology and
          having a clear mindset. One way I clear my head is going fishing,
          fishing is a great way to learn how to be patient and get a sense of
          gratification for the things we have in life.

          <p>
            Build-It is a search engine application that helps users find
            information on how to complete their DIY projects. A user can
            utilize the search engine to find how-to-video on building videos,
            and get inspired with product items to help with decorating their
            projects. The programming languages used to build the application
            are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery library. Finally, to pull the
            data for the search engine, the YouTube and Etsy API were needed to
            send back the results to the users.

          <p>
            Motivate The Mind is a mental health game designed to relieve stress
            and anxiety. The user should feel a sense of positivity and have a
            clearer mindset after the game is played. The game is played by
            going through a series of slides that are designed to stimulate the
            brain's motor cortex. The application is built on many different
            programming languages. The front-end is built using React,
            JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. The backend is supported by NodeJS,
            Express, and Postgresql. Together the frontend and backend work well
            demonstrating the knowledge I have attained over my coding career.

          <p>
            Automotive Quiz is a testing application that enables service
            centers to test mechanic's knowledge. The application allows the
            user to go through a series of questions and tells the employer if
            their answer was right or wrong. Finally, the application brings the
            user to a result page where after finishing all the questions they
            get their results on whether they passed the test. Utilization of
            this application can be a supplemental feature during the interview
            process of hiring a potential service technician. Programming
            languages used were HTML5 and CSS to build the foundation of the
            application. Furthermore, this application functionality is
            supported by the implementation Javascript and JQuery library,
            making for an interactive and responsive application.
