        <h1>
          Hello, I’m Terrance Chang.
        </h1>
        <p>
          I'm a Full Stack Web Developer, and I can bring value to your company
          by designing and implementing a custom website that your customers
          will enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a web developer I embrace difficult coding problems, and whether
          working within a team or working indivdually the knowledge to gain by
          solving diffucult problem will further advance my software develop
          career. Moreover web development presents the opportunity for me to
          express my design creativity in the aspect of utilizing technique such
          as choose the right color palette, experimenting with different fonts,
          and responsive design. Finally, my meticulous coding approach
          functionality of website design is to always optimize my code
          functions, use different libraries when appropriate, and secure
          website to prevent hacking vulnerability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Away from my computer, I really enjoy a active lifestyle whether it be
          working out at the gym, walking my cat, or fixing cars. For me it’s
          important to find the happy medium of detoxing from technology by
          taking up alternative hobbies. I’m a strong believer in DIY (Do It
          Yourself) and a student of self-improvement by speaking with experts
          of multiple subject matters.

            Build-It is a search engine that helps users find information on how
            to complete their own DIY projects. A user can utilize the search
            engine to find how-to-video on building videos, and get inspired
            with product items to help with decorating projects. The programming
            languages used to build the application are HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
            and jQuery library. Finally in order to pull the data for the search
            engine, the YouTube and Etsy API were needed to return the results
            back to the users.

          <p>
            Motivate The Mind is a mental health game design to relieve stress
            and anxiety. The user should feel a sense of positivity and have a
            clearier mindset after the game is played. The game is played by
            going through a series of slides that are designed to stimulate the
            brain's mortor cortex. The application is built on many different
            programming languages. The front-end is built using React,
            JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. The backend is supported by NodeJS,
            Express, and Postgresql. Together the frontend and backend work well
            together demonstrating the knowledge I have attained over my coding
            career.
