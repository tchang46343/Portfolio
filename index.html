                    I’m a web developer and recent graduate of the Front End Web Development Career Path bootcamp at Thinkful. I embrace and find satisfying 
                    the challenges of coding in having to problem solve, and seeing new creation come to life on a webpage. My meticulous thought approach to 
                    always optimize my code functions and utilizing different libraries is what set my project to have the most enjoyable user experience.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Away from my computer, I really enjoyed an active lifestyle whether it be working out at the gym, walking my cat, or fixing cars. For me 
                    it’s important to find the happy medium of detoxing from technology by taking up alternative hobbies. I’m a strong believer in 
                    DIY (Do It Yourself) and a student of self-improvement by speaking with experts of multiple subject matters.

                Car Enthusiast is a program that tests your knowledge about the basic mechanics of a gasoline powered car. The program allows the user to 
                go through a series of questions, and tells the user if their answer was right or wrong. Finally, the program brings the user to a result
                page where after finishing all the questions they get their results on whether they passed the test. Using  HTML5 and CSS to lay the 
                foundation of the program we have transition from idea, to proof of concept. Furthermore, this program functionality really comes to life
                by implementing Javascript and JQuery Library making for a interactive and responsive program.
