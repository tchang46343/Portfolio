        <h1>
          Hello, I’m Terrance Chang.
        </h1>
        <p>
          I'm a Full Stack Web Developer whose designs and implements backend
          and frontend website specialized to your business.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a web developer and recent graduate of the Engineering Flex program
          at Thinkful. I embrace complex coding challenges and like to problem
          solve. I find web development and great opportunity for me to to be
          creative, and seeing my creations come to fruition on a webpage. My
          meticulous coding approach is to always optimize my code functions,
          utilizing different libraries/techniques, and make secure website to
          deter hackers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Away from my computer, I really enjoyed an active lifestyle whether it
          be working out at the gym, walking my cat, or fixing cars. For me it’s
          important to find the happy medium of detoxing from technology by
          taking up alternative hobbies. I’m a strong believer in DIY (Do It
          Yourself) and a student of self-improvement by speaking with experts
          of multiple subject matters.

          <p>
            Automotive Quiz is a testing application that enables service center
            to test a mechanics knowledge. The program allows the user to go
            through a series of questions, and tells the user if their answer
            was right or wrong. Finally, the program brings the user to a result
            page where after finishing all the questions they get their results
            on whether they passed the test. Utilization of this program can now
            let service center companies conduct a more thorough examination of
            a candidate before investing. Using HTML5 and CSS to lay the
            foundation of the program we have transition from idea, to proof of
            concept. Furthermore, this program functionality really comes to
            life by implementing Javascript and JQuery Library making for a
            interactive and responsive program.
